to start game enter command:start user easy(user means you are X player easy means you play againnst easy bot 
similarly you can watch how 2 bots fight ex: start medium hard  where medium is X hard is O )
or you can choose difficulty from easy meadium and hard 
easy makes totally random moves 
medium wins or prevents you to win if it can otherwise makes random move
hard is undefeatable since it uses minmax algorithm. max you can do is draw
