# TicTacToe-With-AI

to start game enter command:start user easy(user means you are X player easy means you play againnst easy bot 
similarly you can watch how 2 bots fight ex: start medium hard or play with yourself ex: start user user ).
you can choose difficulty from easy medium and hard .
easy makes totally random moves.
medium wins or prevents you to win if it can,otherwise makes random move.
hard is undefeatable since it uses minmax algorithm. max you can do is draw.
